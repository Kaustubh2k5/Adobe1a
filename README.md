## Technical Approach Explanation

This project is designed to extract and prioritize content from multiple PDF documents, responding to a user-defined persona and job/task description. The solution combines robust PDF parsing, unsupervised natural language processing, and modular software engineering. Here, we detail the technical reasoning and choices behind each component.

### 1. *PDF Parsing and Section Detection*

*Library Choice:*  
We use PyPDF2 for PDF reading and text extraction. PyPDF2 is lightweight, widely supported, and allows page-wise text extraction without external dependencies. This granularity is crucial for isolating sections and handling documents with complex layouts.

*Section Detection:*  
Sections are identified using a regular expression that matches patterns commonly seen in document headers (e.g., "3.1 INTRODUCTION", "GLUTEN-FREE OPTIONS"). This approach is chosen for its flexibility in handling both numbered and titled headers, and its domain-agnostic nature—no reliance on document-specific structure or formatting.

### 2. *Relevance Ranking with TF-IDF*

*Algorithm Choice:*  
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is employed via scikit-learn’s TfidfVectorizer. This unsupervised method is chosen because:
- It does not require annotated training data (important given arbitrary document domains).
- It captures word importance both locally (within a section) and globally (across documents).
- It is computationally efficient and interpretable.

*Similarity Calculation:*  
Cosine similarity is calculated between the persona/job query and each section and subsection, prioritizing those with the highest semantic overlap. This enables context-sensitive retrieval rather than mere keyword matching.

### 3. *Recursive Subsection Analysis*

After top sections are ranked, subsections within those sections are extracted and re-ranked. This recursive application of TF-IDF and similarity scoring:
- Surfaces highly specific, actionable content.
- Mimics how domain experts might "drill down" from broad topics to precise information.
- Is robust to noisy or unstructured documents.

### 4. *Data Structures and Output*

*Why JSON?*  
JSON is chosen for output because it is language-agnostic, human-readable, and easily consumed by downstream tools (e.g., dashboards, APIs). The output includes:
- Cleaned filenames (for traceability),
- Ranked section and subsection details,
- Metadata (persona, job, timestamp).

*Output Format:*  
A single output.json file ensures simplicity and clarity for users and integrators.

### 5. *Deployment and Usability*

*Command-line Interface:*  
We use argparse for flexible parameterization, making the tool scriptable and automatable.

*Dockerization:*  
A Dockerfile is provided for reproducible, isolated execution, ensuring consistent dependency management and easy deployment across platforms.

---

### 6. *Design Rationale*

- *Domain Agnosticism:* By relying on structural text patterns and unsupervised NLP, the tool adapts to diverse PDFs (menus, legal docs, manuals, etc.).
- *Scalability:* Efficient algorithms and data handling allow scaling to large document sets.
- *User-Centricity:* Persona and job/task inputs allow fine-grained, context-driven information retrieval.

---

*In summary:*  
Every technical choice—from PyPDF2 and regular expressions to TF-IDF and JSON output—was made for robustness, speed, transparency, and adaptability. This ensures that the system is practical for real-world use cases where users need to extract the most relevant content from arbitrary document collections, tailored to their unique context.
